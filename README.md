### `Installation Guide`

- It's better to have the latest version of python. 
- Install following two python packages if you don't have them via pip. `emoji` and `enlighten`
- Create `ghtoken.txt` and put your github access token in it. Follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) steps in order to find your access token.
- Finaly, in order to see in realtime what's happening, run the following command from your terminal. `python ghtop.py tail` Feel free to pick one of the following options `quad`, `users`, `simple`, `tail`. I picked `tail` for this specific example.
